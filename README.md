EZTVParser
==========

I like EZTV very much, but there is no official API.<br />
So I decided to make an unofficial API with my favorite language - Python!<br /><br />
<b>Please feel free to send PR or open issues :-)</b>

## Example ##
Just simply run them, no sweat!<br /><br />
Optional: You can put these scripts to cron, set the interval to everyday and write the results to your server.<br />
So you can access these API in any time.

##Requirements
* Python 2.7 - http://www.python.org/
* BeautifulSoup4 - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
* Requests - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
